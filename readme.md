# 5-Stage RISC-V 32-bit Pipelined Processor

## Overview
This project implements a **5-stage 32-bit Pipelined RISC-V processor**. The pipeline architecture is designed to increase instruction throughput by dividing the instruction execution process into five distinct stages:
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**: Fetches the instruction from the instruction memory.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**: Decodes the instruction and reads register operands.
3. **Execute (EX)**: Performs arithmetic or logical operations in the ALU.
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**: Accesses data memory for load or store operations.
5. **Write Back (WB)**: Writes the result back to the register file.

The processor is compliant with the RISC-V ISA, supporting arithmetic, logical, memory, and control-flow instructions.
